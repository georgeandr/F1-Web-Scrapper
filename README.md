## About the Project 

This project is developed to get hands-on experience with Web Scrapping libraries such as Beautiful Soup. At first, I will use Beautiful Soup to scrape annually Driver Standings from the beginning of Formula 1 back in 1950. Later on, I will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizations based on the scrapped data.
